      <h1>Decline in American Education</h1>
      
      <h2>Are America's schools falling behind?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past few decades, test scores, graduation rates, and global rankings have raised a hard question: Is our education system giving students what they need to succeed?
      </p>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>1. Falling Behind Globally</h3>
        <p>
          American students consistently score below average in math, reading, and science compared to other developed countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the most recent PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) report, the U.S. ranked behind nations like Finland, Japan, and Canada in critical thinking and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't about intelligence—it's about priorities. Many top-ranked nations invest heavily in teacher training, smaller class sizes, and equitable access to resources.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>2. Inequality in Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          The zip code gap is real. Schools in wealthier areas have newer technology, more experienced teachers, and stronger funding. Meanwhile, schools in low-income communities often struggle with outdated materials and overcrowded classrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This imbalance creates cycles where students in underfunded districts fall further behind, not because of ability, but because of access.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>3. Teaching to the Test</h3>
        <p>
          Since the early 2000s, policies like No Child Left Behind and Common Core pushed standardized testing as a measure of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          While accountability is important, over-testing can narrow the focus to memorization—leaving less time for creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many educators argue that learning should be about understanding, not just scoring.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>4. The Teacher Crisis</h3>
        <p>
          Teaching used to be seen as a calling. Today, burnout, low pay, and lack of support are driving many teachers out of the profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          High turnover means less stability for students and fewer experienced mentors guiding classrooms.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>5. Technology and Distraction</h3>
        <p>
          The digital world offers endless learning opportunities—but also endless distractions. Social media, screen fatigue, and unequal access to reliable internet have created new challenges for both students and teachers.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="decline-section">
        <h3>6. Looking Forward</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the challenges, hope remains. Communities, educators, and policymakers across the country are experimenting with innovative learning models, mental-health supports, and career-based education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvement begins with awareness—and awareness begins here.
