      <h1><strong>History of Education</strong></h1>
      
      <h2><strong>What does it mean to be educated?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Being educated isn't just about memorizing facts or passing tests. It's about learning how to think — to question, create, and understand the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        True education shapes not only what we know, but how we see ourselves and others. It's the foundation that helps us navigate life's challenges and contribute meaningfully to society.

      <h2><strong>How did America's education system begin?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In the 1800s, schooling was local and simple. One-room schoolhouses dotted the countryside, with teachers paid by the town and lessons built around reading, writing, and arithmetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education was a privilege, not a guarantee. Many children worked on farms or in factories instead of attending school. The idea that every child deserved an education was still taking shape.
      </p>
      
      <h2><strong>The birth of public education</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Over time, the idea grew that every child deserved the chance to learn. States began creating public schools, funded by communities and open to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reformers like Horace Mann called education "the great equalizer," believing it could strengthen democracy and reduce inequality. This vision would shape American education for generations to come.
      </p>
      
      <h2><strong>From segregation to inclusion</strong></h2>
      <p>
        For decades, not everyone had equal access to learning. Schools were often segregated by race, limiting opportunities for many students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Landmark moments like Brown v. Board of Education (1954) challenged segregation and pushed schools toward greater equity. However, the struggle for fairness continues today as we work to ensure every child receives a quality education.
      </p>
      
      <h2><strong>Education today</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Our modern system—public, private, and charter schools—reflects centuries of change. We now have more options and opportunities than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the debates we face about funding, testing, and teacher support are rooted in the same fundamental question we've faced all along: <strong>What does it mean to truly be educated in America?</strong>
